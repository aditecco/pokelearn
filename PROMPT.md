### Prompt Template
Build a learning app targeted at 2nd-graders, with a Pokemon theme.

#### Mechanics:

- User is presented with a Challenge with selectable difficulty level
  - Each grade has 3 difficulty levels (i.e. 2nd grade; difficulty Easy, Medium, Hard)
  - Each won challenge scores points
  - Greater difficulty level earns more points
  - User gets 3 tries, after which the challenge fails and User can request a new challenge
  - A failed challenge deducts points from the overall score
- If challenge is solved, user can request a random Pokemon
- After a certain amount of points is reached, User earns the ability to request a legendary Pokemon
- Pokemon is presented in a  card, with image and detailed info including playable sounds
- User can save the Pokemon to a Pokemon collection
- Pokemon collection can be browsed and consulted at any time

- Data saved locally in the browser, also in structured formats like IndexedDB (recommend)
- App can be statically hosted ( Vercel, Netlify)
